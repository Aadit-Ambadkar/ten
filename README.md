# TEN
This is the Official Source Code for the Programming Language, TEN

Use, and other information can be found in the `docs` folder, in `docs.md`.

Sidenote: The name is a joke, given the fact that there is no way to write any number 10 or higher. See the Examples in the `docs.txt` for information on how to get around this.

Below shows a sample TEN file being run.
